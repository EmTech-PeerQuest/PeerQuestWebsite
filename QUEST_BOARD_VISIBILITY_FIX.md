ðŸ”§ Quest Board Visibility Fix Summary
========================================

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Quest Board Not Showing
**Problem**: The quest board component was hidden by conditional loading logic that depended on page-level quest state.
**Solution**: Removed the `questsLoaded` check from page.tsx to allow the quest board component to handle its own loading state internally.

### 2. QuestDetailsModal Import Error  
**Problem**: React component import/export mismatch causing "Element type is invalid" error.
**Solution**: 
- Changed from named export to default export in quest-details-modal.tsx
- Updated import in quest-board-clean.tsx to use default import
- Updated components/index.ts to properly re-export the component

## Files Modified:

1. **app/page.tsx**
   - Removed questsLoaded conditional wrapper around QuestBoard component
   - Removed questsLoaded conditional wrapper around QuestManagement component

2. **components/quests/quest-details-modal.tsx**
   - Added default export: `export default QuestDetailsModal`

3. **components/quests/quest-board-clean.tsx** 
   - Changed import from named to default: `import QuestDetailsModal from "./quest-details-modal"`

4. **components/index.ts**
   - Updated export: `export { default as QuestDetailsModal } from '@/components/quests/quest-details-modal'`

## Result:
âœ… Quest board now shows regardless of initial data loading state
âœ… QuestDetailsModal component properly imported and functional
âœ… Build completes successfully with no warnings
âœ… All components are accessible and working

## How to Test:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001
2. Click on the Quest Board navigation 
3. The quest board should be visible even if no quests are loaded initially
4. Quest details modal should work when clicking on quest cards
