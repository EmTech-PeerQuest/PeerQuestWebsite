# 🎵 Enhanced Satisfying Click Sounds

## What's New
The click sound system now features **professionally designed audio** with:

### 🎨 Advanced Audio Design
- **Rich Harmonics**: Multiple frequency layers for warmth and depth
- **Smooth ADSR Envelopes**: Natural attack, decay, sustain, and release phases
- **Subtle Reverb**: Adds spatial depth without muddiness
- **Contextual Frequencies**: Each sound type uses frequencies that match its purpose
- **Optimized Duration**: 150ms for responsiveness without overlap

### 🎯 Sound Characteristics

| Sound Type | Description | Feel | Use Cases |
|------------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **button** | Crisp click + warm resonance | Satisfying, confident | Primary actions, submissions |
| **success** | Rising chord progression | Achievement, completion | Form success, quest completion |
| **nav** | Smooth frequency sweep | Movement, transition | Navigation, page changes |
| **error** | Clear descending tones | Alert but not harsh | Errors, warnings, validation |
| **soft** | Gentle, rounded tone | Subtle, non-intrusive | Cancel, close, secondary actions |
| **tab** | Balanced two-tone harmony | Smooth transition | Tab switching, categories |
| **modal** | Bell-like attention tone | Focus, importance | Modal opening, notifications |
| **hover** | Very subtle feedback | Preview, anticipation | Hover states (optional) |

### 🚀 Technical Improvements
- **Dynamic Volume Fade-in**: Smooth audio start for more polished feel
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when audio files are missing
- **Performance Optimized**: Small file sizes (~13KB each)
- **Browser Compatible**: Standard WAV format works everywhere

### 🎵 Audio Generation
The sounds are procedurally generated using advanced synthesis:
- **Base Frequencies**: Carefully chosen for each interaction type
- **Harmonic Series**: Mathematical ratios for musical consonance  
- **Envelope Shaping**: Professional ADSR curves
- **Reverb Processing**: Algorithmic spatial enhancement

Run `node generate-satisfying-sounds.js` to regenerate the audio files.
