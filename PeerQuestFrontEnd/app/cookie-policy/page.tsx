        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">1. What are cookies?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
          Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently,
          as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, PeerQuest Tavern) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies
          set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable
          third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
          content, and analytics).
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">2. Why do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical
          reasons in order for our platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
          cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience
          on our platform. Third parties serve cookies through our platform for advertising, analytics, and other
          purposes.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like
          preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for
          advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
        </p>
