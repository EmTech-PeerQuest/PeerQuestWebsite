# 🔧 URGENT: Save Your GCash QR Code Image

## Why You're Not Seeing Your Personal QR Code

The system is now configured to use your static GCash QR code, but **you haven't saved the actual image file yet**.

## ✅ Steps to Fix This:

### 1. Save Your QR Code Image
Take the GCash QR code image you shared earlier and save it as:

```
PeerQuestFrontEnd/public/images/payment/gcash-qr.png
```

### 2. Exact File Location
The file path must be exactly:
```
c:\Users\Mark\Desktop\PeerQuestWebsite\PeerQuestFrontEnd\public\images\payment\gcash-qr.png
```

### 3. File Requirements
- **File name**: Must be exactly `gcash-qr.png` (lowercase)
- **Format**: PNG image
- **Location**: Inside the `public/images/payment/` folder (already created)

## 🔍 How to Do This:

1. **Right-click** on your GCash QR code image (the blue one with your info)
2. **Save As** or **Copy** the image
3. **Navigate** to: `PeerQuestFrontEnd/public/images/payment/`
4. **Save/Paste** the image as `gcash-qr.png`

## 🎯 After Saving the Image:

Your gold purchase modal will show:
- ✅ **Your actual GCash QR code** (the blue one with "MA*K JO*N WA**E Y.")
- ✅ **Your GCash number**: 099****524
- ✅ **Your User ID**: WMHFTN

## 🔧 Current Configuration:
```typescript
USE_STATIC_GCASH_QR: true  // ✅ Using your static QR
GCASH_QR_IMAGE_PATH: '/images/payment/gcash-qr.png'  // ✅ Correct path
GCASH_MERCHANT_NAME: 'MA*K JO*N WA**E Y.'  // ✅ Your GCash name
```

## 🚨 Important:
The directory exists, but the **image file is missing**. Once you save your QR code image to the correct location, it will display your personal GCash QR code instead of the generated ones!

**Next Step**: Save your GCash QR image to `public/images/payment/gcash-qr.png` and refresh the page!
