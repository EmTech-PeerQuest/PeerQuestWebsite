ðŸ”§ Final Quest Board Import/Export Fix Summary
=============================================

## Root Issue:
Mixed named and default exports for the QuestDetailsModal component were causing "Element type is invalid" errors.

## Files Fixed:

### 1. components/quests/quest-details-modal.tsx
**Changes:**
- Removed named export: `export function QuestDetailsModal` â†’ `function QuestDetailsModal`
- Kept only default export: `export default QuestDetailsModal`

### 2. components/quests/quest-board-clean.tsx  
**Changes:**
- Import changed from named to default: `import QuestDetailsModal from "./quest-details-modal"`

### 3. components/quests/quest-management.tsx
**Changes:**
- Import changed from named to default: `import QuestDetailsModal from "./quest-details-modal"`

### 4. components/index.ts
**Changes:**
- Updated export to use default: `export { default as QuestDetailsModal } from '@/components/quests/quest-details-modal'`

## Technical Details:
The issue occurred because:
1. QuestDetailsModal had both `export function QuestDetailsModal` AND `export default QuestDetailsModal`
2. This created ambiguity in the module system
3. Different files were importing it differently (some named, some default)
4. React couldn't resolve the component properly, causing the "Element type is invalid" error

## Resolution:
- Standardized on **default exports only** for the component
- Updated all import statements to use default import syntax
- Removed conflicting named export
- Restarted development server to clear module cache

## Current Status:
âœ… Quest board loads without errors
âœ… QuestDetailsModal component properly imported
âœ… All builds compile successfully
âœ… No import/export conflicts
âœ… Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000

## Testing:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click on Quest Board
3. Quest board should load with no errors
4. Quest details modal should work when clicking quest cards
