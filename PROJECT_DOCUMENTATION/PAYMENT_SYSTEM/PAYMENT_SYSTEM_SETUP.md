# Payment System Setup Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

I've implemented a real payment processing system for your PeerQuest platform with manual verification for personal GCash accounts.

## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

### Frontend Changes:
- ✅ Real payment flow with receipt upload
- ✅ Payment reference generation for tracking
- ✅ File upload with validation (5MB limit, image files only)
- ✅ Step-by-step payment process: Confirm → Pay → Upload Receipt → Pending Verification
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

### Backend Changes:
- ✅ New `payments` app with complete model structure
- ✅ Payment proof model with status tracking
- ✅ Admin interface for manual verification
- ✅ API endpoints for receipt submission
- ✅ Automatic gold addition upon verification
- ✅ Transaction record creation

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations
```bash
cd PeerQuestBackEnd
python manage.py makemigrations payments
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Create Media Directory
```bash
mkdir media
mkdir media/payment_receipts
```

### 3. Update Settings (if needed)
Make sure your `settings.py` has these media settings:
```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
```

### 4. Install Pillow (for image handling)
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## 📋 How It Works

### For Users:
1. **Select Package** - Choose gold package from Buy Gold tab
2. **Confirm Purchase** - Review package details
3. **Make Payment** - Scan QR code and pay via GCash
4. **Upload Receipt** - Upload clear screenshot of payment receipt
5. **Wait for Verification** - Admin verifies payment within 24 hours
6. **Receive Gold** - Gold automatically added to account once verified

### For Admins:
1. **Access Admin Panel** - `/admin/payments/paymentproof/`
2. **Review Receipts** - View uploaded payment receipts
3. **Verify Payments** - Use bulk actions or individual verification
4. **Gold Auto-Added** - System automatically adds gold to user accounts

## 🔧 Admin Interface Features

### Payment Proof Admin:
- **List View**: Shows all payment submissions with status
- **Receipt Preview**: Thumbnail and full-size image preview
- **Bulk Actions**: Verify or reject multiple payments at once
- **Automatic Gold Addition**: Gold added to user accounts upon verification
- **Transaction Records**: Automatic transaction history creation
- **Search & Filter**: Find payments by reference, user, amount, status

### Verification Process:
1. Admin sees new payment submissions in "Pending" status
2. Admin clicks on payment to view details and receipt image
3. Admin verifies the receipt shows correct amount and reference
4. Admin changes status to "Verified" or uses bulk action
5. System automatically adds gold to user account
6. User receives notification (can be extended with email)

## 📊 Database Schema

### PaymentProof Model:
- `user`: Foreign key to User
- `payment_reference`: Unique reference for tracking

- `status`: pending/verified/rejected/completed
- `verified_by`: Admin who verified the payment
- `verification_notes`: Admin notes
- `created_at`: Submission timestamp
- `verified_at`: Verification timestamp

## 🔐 Security Features

### Input Validation:
- ✅ Image file type validation
- ✅ File size limits (5MB max)
- ✅ Unique payment reference validation
- ✅ User authentication required
- ✅ CSRF protection

### Admin Protection:
- ✅ Only authenticated admins can verify payments

- ✅ Error handling for failed gold additions

## 📱 User Experience
