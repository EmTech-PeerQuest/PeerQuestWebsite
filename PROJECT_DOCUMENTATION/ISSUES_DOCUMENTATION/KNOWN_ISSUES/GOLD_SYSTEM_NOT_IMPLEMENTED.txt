GOLD SYSTEM NOT IMPLEMENTED - KNOWN ISSUE
================================================================================

Date: July 2, 2025
Issue ID: GOLD-001
Category: UI/UX
Severity: LOW
Status: KNOWN (Planned Feature)

================================================================================
ISSUE DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

The PeerQuest application currently displays gold rewards as "Coming Soon" 
throughout the interface, indicating that the gold system is planned but 
not yet implemented.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
- Quest cards show "Gold Coming Soon" with grayed-out gold icons
- Quest creation forms may reference gold rewards
- User profiles may have placeholder gold displays
- Gold-related UI elements are visible but non-functional

AFFECTED AREAS:
- Quest board quest cards
- Quest management interface
- User profile displays
- Quest creation/editing forms
- Reward calculation systems

================================================================================
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
- Frontend: Gold UI elements present but marked as "Coming Soon"
- Backend: No gold system models or logic implemented
- Database: No gold-related tables or fields
- API: No gold-related endpoints

CURRENT WORKAROUND:
- Gold displays consistently show "Coming Soon" message
- Gold icons are grayed out to indicate unavailability
- Users understand this is a future feature
- No functional impact on current quest system

================================================================================
PLANNED IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

WHEN GOLD SYSTEM IS IMPLEMENTED, IT WILL LIKELY INCLUDE:

Database Changes:
- User gold balance field
- Quest gold reward field
- Gold transaction history table
- Gold earning/spending logs

Backend Implementation:
- Gold calculation logic
- Gold award system (similar to XP)
- Gold transaction API endpoints
- Gold balance management

Frontend Updates:
- Remove "Coming Soon" placeholders
- Enable gold displays and interactions
- Gold transaction interfaces
- Gold reward visualization

Integration Points:
- Quest completion gold awards
- Gold-based quest requirements
- User gold balance displays
- Gold transaction history

================================================================================
IMPACT ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

USER IMPACT: Minimal
- Users aware this is a planned feature
- Clear "Coming Soon" messaging sets expectations
- No confusion about unavailability
- No functional impact on quest participation

BUSINESS IMPACT: None
- Feature is clearly marked as future
- No promises made about availability timeline
- Users can fully use current feature set
- No revenue or engagement impact

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT: Low
- UI framework already in place
- Clear implementation path when ready
- No blocking issues for current features
- Ready for future enhancement

================================================================================
CURRENT UI IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

QUEST CARDS:
```jsx
// Gold shown as "Coming Soon" with grayed styling
<div className="flex items-center text-gray-400">
  <Coins className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
  <span className="text-sm">Coming Soon</span>
</div>
```

QUEST MANAGEMENT:
- Gold sections clearly marked as coming soon
- Consistent styling across all gold elements
- No functional gold-related buttons or inputs

USER FEEDBACK:
- Clear visual indicators of future feature
- No user confusion reported
- Expectations properly set

================================================================================
FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

DESIGN DECISIONS TO MAKE:
1. Gold earning rates per quest difficulty
2. Gold spending mechanisms (if any)
3. Gold-based quest requirements
4. Gold transaction limits
5. Gold balance persistence

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Database schema for gold system
2. Transaction safety for gold operations
3. Gold calculation algorithms
4. API endpoint design
5. Frontend state management

INTEGRATION PLANNING:
1. Gold + XP combined reward system
2. Gold-based guild features
3. Gold marketplace possibilities
4. Achievement system integration

================================================================================
MONITORING
================================================================================

USER FEEDBACK:
- Monitor for requests about gold system
- Track user understanding of "Coming Soon"
- Watch for confusion about gold availability

DEVELOPMENT READINESS:
- UI framework ready for implementation
- Database design can be planned
- API structure can be designed
- Integration points identified

BUSINESS READINESS:
- Feature value proposition to be defined
- Implementation priority to be determined
- Resource allocation planning needed

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (FOR FUTURE)
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Backend Foundation
â–¡ Design gold database schema
â–¡ Implement gold models
â–¡ Create gold calculation logic
â–¡ Build gold transaction system
â–¡ Add gold API endpoints

PHASE 2: Frontend Integration  
â–¡ Remove "Coming Soon" placeholders
â–¡ Implement gold displays
â–¡ Add gold transaction interfaces
â–¡ Update quest creation forms
â–¡ Enable gold-related interactions

PHASE 3: Testing & Validation
â–¡ Test gold calculation accuracy
â–¡ Verify transaction safety
â–¡ Validate UI/UX flows
â–¡ Test integration with existing systems
â–¡ Performance testing with gold operations

PHASE 4: Deployment
â–¡ Database migration for gold fields
â–¡ Backend deployment with gold features
â–¡ Frontend deployment with active gold UI
â–¡ User communication about new feature
â–¡ Monitoring and issue tracking

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
================================================================================

OPTION 1: Simple Gold System
- Fixed gold amounts per quest difficulty
- No spending mechanisms
- Display-only gold accumulation
- Minimal implementation complexity

OPTION 2: Complex Gold Economy
- Variable gold rewards
- Gold spending features
- Gold-based quest requirements
- Marketplace integration

OPTION 3: Gold + Achievement System
- Gold tied to achievements
- Special gold rewards for milestones
- Gold-based unlockables
- Gamification focus

RECOMMENDATION: Start with Option 1 for MVP

================================================================================
COMMUNICATIONS
================================================================================

USER MESSAGING:
- "Coming Soon" clearly indicates future feature
- No timeline promises made to users
- Consistent messaging across all gold elements
- Users can provide feedback on desired features

STAKEHOLDER UPDATES:
- Gold system is planned but not prioritized
- Implementation timeline depends on resources
- Current system fully functional without gold
- User experience not impacted by absence

================================================================================
RELATED FEATURES
================================================================================

DEPENDENT SYSTEMS:
- Quest reward system (already implemented for XP)
- User profile system (ready for gold integration)
- Achievement system (potential gold integration)
- Guild system (potential gold features)

SIMILAR IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- XP system can serve as model for gold
- Reward calculation patterns established
- Database patterns for user resources exist
- API patterns for resource management exist

================================================================================
STATUS: ðŸ”„ KNOWN - PLANNED FEATURE
================================================================================

This is not a bug or issue requiring immediate resolution. It represents
a planned feature that has been properly communicated to users through
"Coming Soon" messaging.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Continue monitoring user feedback
2. Plan gold system design when resources available
3. Maintain current "Coming Soon" messaging
4. Consider gold system in future development cycles

NO IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
