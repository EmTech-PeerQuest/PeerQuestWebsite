AUDIT TOOLS DOCUMENTATION - PREVENTION TOOLS
================================================================================

Date: July 2, 2025
Tool Category: DATA INTEGRITY MONITORING
Status: DEPLOYED AND ACTIVE

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This document describes the audit tools deployed to prevent and detect data
synchronization issues in the PeerQuest application. These tools were created
in response to SYNC-001 and are designed to prevent similar issues from
occurring in the future.

PRIMARY TOOL: audit_application_participant_sync.py
- Location: c:\Users\Mark\Desktop\PeerQuestWebsite\PeerQuestBackEnd\quests\management\commands\
- Purpose: Detect and fix data synchronization issues between Applications and QuestParticipants
- Status: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED AND TESTED

================================================================================
AUDIT TOOL CAPABILITIES
================================================================================

DETECTION CATEGORIES:
1. Approved applications without corresponding participant records
2. Participant records without approved applications  
3. Quest status inconsistencies (participants but status still 'open')
4. Assignment inconsistencies (participants but no assigned user)
5. Duplicate participant records

EXECUTION MODES:
- Read-only audit (default)
- Detailed reporting (--detailed)
- Automatic fixes (--fix-issues)
- Dry-run preview (--dry-run)
- User-specific audit (--user username)

SAFETY FEATURES:
- Transaction-safe operations
- Rollback on failure
- Dry-run mode for change preview
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling with graceful degradation

================================================================================
USAGE DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

BASIC COMMANDS:

1. STANDARD AUDIT (Read-only):
```bash
python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync
```
- Checks all users for data synchronization issues
- Reports findings without making changes
- Provides summary of issues found
- Safe to run at any time

2. DETAILED AUDIT:
```bash
python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync --detailed
```
- Shows specific details for each issue found
- Lists affected users, quests, and data states
- Provides comprehensive issue descriptions
- Useful for investigation and diagnosis

3. PREVIEW FIXES:
```bash
python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync --fix-issues --dry-run
```
- Shows what changes would be made
- Safe preview mode (no actual changes)
- Allows review before applying fixes
- Recommended before running actual fixes

4. APPLY FIXES:
```bash
python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync --fix-issues
```
- Automatically resolves discovered issues
- Uses database transactions for safety
- Provides detailed logging of changes made
- Should be run after reviewing dry-run output

5. USER-SPECIFIC AUDIT:
```bash
python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync --user student2
```
- Audits only the specified user
- Useful for investigating specific user issues
- Can be combined with other flags
- Faster execution for targeted checks

================================================================================
AUDIT PHASES EXPLANATION
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Approved Applications Without Participants
- Identifies applications marked as 'approved' 
- Checks for corresponding QuestParticipant records
- Flags missing participant records
- FIX: Creates missing QuestParticipant records via quest.assign_to_user()

PHASE 2: Participants Without Approved Applications
- Identifies QuestParticipant records
- Checks for corresponding approved Application records  
- Flags orphaned participant records
- NOTE: This might indicate legitimate direct quest assignments

PHASE 3: Quest Status Inconsistencies
- Identifies quests with active participants
- Checks if quest status is appropriate
- Flags quests that should be 'in-progress' but are 'open'
- FIX: Updates quest status to 'in-progress'

PHASE 4: Assignment Inconsistencies  
- Identifies quests with participants but no assigned user
- Flags missing quest assignments
- FIX: Assigns quest to earliest participant

PHASE 5: Duplicate Participants
- Identifies multiple QuestParticipant records for same user+quest
- Flags data duplication issues
- NOTE: Requires manual investigation (not auto-fixed)

```

================================================================================
AUTOMATION AND SCHEDULING
================================================================================

RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE:
- Weekly automated audit (read-only)
- Monthly detailed review
- On-demand audits after system changes
- Post-deployment verification audits

AUTOMATION SETUP:

1. Weekly Cron Job (Linux/Mac):
```bash
# Add to crontab (crontab -e)
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync >> /var/log/peerquest_audit.log 2>&1
```

2. Windows Task Scheduler:
```powershell
# Create scheduled task for weekly audit
schtasks /create /tn "PeerQuest Weekly Audit" /tr "cd c:\path\to\project && python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync" /sc weekly /d MON /st 09:00
```

3. CI/CD Integration:
```yaml
# Add to deployment pipeline
audit_check:
  stage: post-deploy
  script:
    - python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync
  only:
    - main
```

================================================================================
MONITORING AND ALERTING
================================================================================

LOG MONITORING PATTERNS:
- Monitor for "TOTAL ISSUES: X" where X > 0
- Alert on "‚ö†Ô∏è" or "‚ùå" patterns in audit output
- Track "‚úÖ All issues have been resolved!" for successful fixes
- Monitor audit execution frequency and timing

ALERTING SETUP:

1. Log File Monitoring:
```bash
# Watch for issues in audit logs
tail -f /var/log/peerquest_audit.log | grep "TOTAL ISSUES:" | grep -v "TOTAL ISSUES: 0"
```

2. Email Alerts:
```bash
# Send email if issues found
python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync | grep -q "TOTAL ISSUES: 0" || echo "PeerQuest data issues detected" | mail -s "PeerQuest Alert" admin@example.com
```

3. Slack/Discord Integration:
```python
# Post audit results to chat
audit_result = subprocess.run(['python', 'manage.py', 'audit_application_participant_sync'], capture_output=True)
if 'TOTAL ISSUES: 0' not in audit_result.stdout.decode():
    post_to_slack("üö® PeerQuest data synchronization issues detected!")
```

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON ISSUES:

1. "Permission denied" or "Command not found"
   - Ensure you're in the correct directory (PeerQuestBackEnd)
   - Check Python environment activation
   - Verify Django project setup

2. "No module named 'applications'"
   - Ensure Django settings are correctly configured
   - Check that all apps are in INSTALLED_APPS
   - Verify database connectivity

3. "Transaction rolled back"
   - Usually indicates a deeper database issue
   - Check database logs for specific errors
   - Ensure database integrity

4. Audit takes too long
   - Use --user flag for specific user audits
   - Check database performance
   - Consider audit frequency adjustment

5. False positives in results
   - Review --detailed output for context
   - Check for legitimate direct quest assignments
   - Verify business logic requirements
