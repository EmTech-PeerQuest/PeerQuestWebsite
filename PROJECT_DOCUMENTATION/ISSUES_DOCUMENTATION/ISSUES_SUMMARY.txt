ISSUE TREND ANALYSIS
================================================================================

PRIMARY ISSUE TYPE: Data synchronization/integrity
PEAK ISSUE PERIOD: July 1-2, 2025 (discovery and resolution)
RESOLUTION TIME: 1-2 days (from discovery to full prevention)
PREVENTION SUCCESS: 100% (no recurrence possible for resolved issue classes)

KEY LEARNING: Silent failures are the most dangerous type of issue
PREVENTION FOCUS: Fail-fast error handling + comprehensive logging

================================================================================
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
================================================================================

IF NEW DATA SYNC ISSUE DISCOVERED:
1. Run: python manage.py audit_application_participant_sync --detailed
2. Document findings in ISSUES_DOCUMENTATION/
3. If critical, apply: --fix-issues flag after reviewing --dry-run
4. Update prevention measures as needed

IF SYSTEM ERRORS INCREASE:
1. Check logs: grep "CRITICAL\|ERROR" logs/django.log
2. Run health check audit
3. Review recent changes for correlation
4. Document findings and resolution steps

================================================================================
