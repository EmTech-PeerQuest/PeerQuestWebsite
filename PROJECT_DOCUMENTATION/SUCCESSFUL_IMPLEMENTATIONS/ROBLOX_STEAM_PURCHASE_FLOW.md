## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```bash
npm install qrcode --legacy-peer-deps
npm install @types/qrcode --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Key Components

#### State Management
```typescript
// Purchase flow state
const [showPurchaseModal, setShowPurchaseModal] = useState(false)
const [selectedPackage, setSelectedPackage] = useState<{amount: number, price: number, bonus?: string} | null>(null)
const [purchaseStep, setPurchaseStep] = useState<"confirm" | "payment" | "processing" | "success">("confirm")
const [qrCodeDataUrl, setQrCodeDataUrl] = useState<string>("")
const [paymentReference, setPaymentReference] = useState<string>("")
const [paymentTimeout, setPaymentTimeout] = useState<number>(300) // 5 minutes
```

#### QR Code Generation
```typescript
const generateQRCode = async (paymentData: any) => {
  const gcashPaymentData = {
    merchant: "PeerQuest",
    amount: paymentData.price,
    currency: "PHP",
    reference: paymentData.reference,
    description: `${paymentData.amount} Gold Coins${paymentData.bonus ? ` (${paymentData.bonus})` : ''}`,
    callback_url: `https://peerquest.com/payment/callback/${paymentData.reference}`
  }

  const qrCodeData = JSON.stringify(gcashPaymentData)
  const dataUrl = await QRCode.toDataURL(qrCodeData, {
    width: 256,
    margin: 2,
    color: {
      dark: '#2C1A1D',
      light: '#FFFFFF'
    }
  })
  
  setQrCodeDataUrl(dataUrl)
}
```

#### Payment Reference Generation
```typescript
const generatePaymentReference = () => {
  const timestamp = Date.now()
  const random = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8).toUpperCase()
  return `PQ${timestamp}${random}`
}
```
