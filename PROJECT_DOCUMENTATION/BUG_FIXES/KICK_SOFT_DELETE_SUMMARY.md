# Kick Functionality - Soft Delete Implementation âœ…

## Updated Implementation Summary

The kick functionality has been **updated to use soft delete** (status changes only) instead of hard delete, ensuring all records are preserved in the database for application logs and audit trails.

### How It Works Now

#### Before Kick:
- **Application**: status = 'approved'
- **QuestParticipant**: status = 'joined' 
- **Quest**: status = 'in_progress' or 'assigned'

#### After Kick:
- **Application**: status = 'kicked' âœ… (record preserved)
- **QuestParticipant**: status = 'dropped' âœ… (record preserved)  
- **Quest**: status = 'open' (if no other approved participants)

### Key Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: All applications remain visible in application logs
2. **Data Integrity**: No data loss - all records preserved
3. **Transparency**: Users can see the full history of applications and decisions
4. **Consistency**: Works exactly like 'reject' - status change only
5. **Reversibility**: Could potentially implement un-kick functionality in future

### Database Records

```sql
-- Applications table - kicked records remain
SELECT * FROM applications_application WHERE status = 'kicked';

-- QuestParticipant table - dropped participants remain  
SELECT * FROM quests_questparticipant WHERE status = 'dropped';
```

### Frontend Display

- âœ… Kicked applications appear in application logs with orange 'kicked' status
- âœ… Complete application history preserved
- âœ… Quest creators can see who was kicked and when
- âœ… Kicked users see their status clearly
- âœ… No data disappears from the UI

### API Behavior

The `/api/applications/{id}/kick/` endpoint now:
- Changes Application.status from 'approved' â†’ 'kicked'
- Changes QuestParticipant.status from 'joined' â†’ 'dropped'
- Records reviewer and timestamp
- Keeps all records in database
- Returns full application data including kick details

### Comparison with Reject

| Action | Application Status | Record Kept | Appears in Logs |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Reject | 'pending' â†’ 'rejected' | âœ… Yes | âœ… Yes |
| Kick   | 'approved' â†’ 'kicked' | âœ… Yes | âœ… Yes |

Both operations now work identically as soft deletes, ensuring complete data preservation and transparency.

## âœ… Ready for Production

The kick functionality now properly implements soft delete behavior:
- All records preserved for audit trails
- Complete application history maintained  
- Consistent with reject behavior
- Full transparency for all users
- No data loss or missing logs

Perfect! ðŸŽ¯
