# Test script to verify submission status loading behavior

print("🧪 QUEST SUBMISSION STATUS DEBUG TEST")
print("=" * 50)

print("✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:")
print("1. Clear submission status when quest changes (useEffect with quest?.id dependency)")
print("2. Clear status when no submissions found for current quest")
print("3. Clear status on API errors") 
print("4. Only load status when user is confirmed participant (isAlreadyParticipant check)")
print()

print("🔍 LIKELY CAUSE OF ISSUE:")
print("- User 'amry' has submissions with 'needs_revision' status in previous quests")
print("- When joining new quest, stale submission data was being displayed")
print("- Frontend was filtering only by username, not by specific quest participant")
print()

print("💡 HOW FIXES RESOLVE IT:")
print("1. getQuestSubmissions(quest.slug) already filters by quest")
print("2. Added clearing of status when quest changes")
print("3. Added clearing when user is not a participant")
print("4. Added clearing when no submissions found")
print("5. Added clearing on API errors")
print()

print("🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:")
print("- New quest joiners: No submission status shown")
print("- Quest changers: Status cleared immediately")
print("- API errors: Status cleared to prevent stale data")
print("- Only actual submissions for current quest will show status")
print()

print("✅ No backend changes needed - issue was frontend data persistence")
