# PeerQuest Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
This document summarizes the key implementations and improvements made to the PeerQuest platform, focusing on the gold transaction system, authentication improvements, and modern purchase flow enhancements.

## Latest Implementation: TokenInvalidError Fix
**Date**: July 6, 2025 (Latest)

### Critical Authentication Fix
- **Issue Resolved**: TokenInvalidError during app initialization completely eliminated
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Invalid tokens now cleared silently during startup
- **Enhanced User Experience**: No error messages shown to users during normal app startup
- **Robust State Management**: Comprehensive auth state cleanup and recovery

### Technical Implementation
- Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to handle token validation gracefully during initialization
- Enhanced `fetchUser` function with detailed error logging for debugging
- Implemented conditional error propagation (silent during init, visible during interaction)
- Added comprehensive console logging for authentication flow debugging

### Benefits Achieved
- **Seamless App Startup**: Users no longer see confusing authentication errors
- **Automatic Recovery**: Invalid tokens automatically cleaned up
- **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging for developer troubleshooting
- **Consistent State**: Auth state always consistent with token validity
