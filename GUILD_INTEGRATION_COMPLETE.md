## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### Backend Development
- ✅ **Fixed database schema issues** - Resolved missing columns and migration problems
- ✅ **Implemented complete guild models** - Guild, GuildTag, GuildSocialLink, GuildMembership, GuildJoinRequest
- ✅ **Created comprehensive API endpoints** - List, Detail, Create, Update, Delete with proper permissions
- ✅ **Fixed serializer issues** - Resolved RelatedManager serialization error for guild creation
- ✅ **Restored proper authentication** - Guild creation now requires authenticated users
- ✅ **Added comprehensive test coverage** - Database integrity and API endpoint tests

### Frontend Development

- ✅ **Implemented API utilities** - Full-featured guild API client with error handling
- ✅ **Created React hooks** - useGuilds hook for state management and API integration
- ✅ **Updated guild components** - Enhanced components compatible with backend API
- ✅ **Built dedicated guild page** - Clean testing and integration environment

### Integration & Testing
- ✅ **End-to-end verification** - Confirmed guild creation adds to database
- ✅ **API response validation** - All endpoints return proper JSON responses
- ✅ **Database relationship testing** - Verified all model relationships work correctly
- ✅ **Frontend-backend communication** - Both servers running and communicating

## 🚀 CURRENT STATUS

### Backend (Django REST API)
- **Server**: ✅ Running on `localhost:8000`
- **Database**: ✅ SQLite with 6 test guilds, 31 users, 5 memberships
- **API Endpoints**: ✅ All functional with proper authentication
- **Guild Creation**: ✅ **WORKING** - Successfully adds to database with 201 response

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Server**: ✅ Running on `localhost:3000`
- **Guild Page**: ✅ Accessible at `/guilds`
- **API Integration**: ✅ Ready for authenticated requests
- **Components**: ✅ Updated for backend compatibility

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Critical Serializer Fix
The main blocker was a `RelatedManager` serialization error in the guild creation API. **RESOLVED** by:
- Making `tags` and `social_links` fields `write_only=True` in the serializer
- Implementing custom `to_representation()` method to handle related fields manually
- Ensuring proper JSON response format for all API operations

### Authentication Restoration
- Guild creation now properly requires `IsAuthenticated` permission
- Removed temporary testing workarounds
- Ready for frontend authentication token integration
